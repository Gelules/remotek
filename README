REMOTEK: Research Environment MOdule for Operational Task Execution from Kernel

It is a pedagogical project to send commands to a Linux module from a server
with maybe more features to come!

Usage:
$ make
$ sudo insmod remotek.ko ip=$IP port=$PORT
...
$ sudo rmmod remotek

Default ip is 127.0.0.1 and default port is 4242.

Do not use IPv6 (yet?).

You need a running server (netcat for example) sending shell commands to receive
the execution results.
